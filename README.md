# Attention-Variational-Autoencoder
An attempt to make an attention variational autoencoder. Here, I will try to encode an image of fixed number of columns and undefined number of rows into a fixed dimension.

Basically, here I will try to convert [None, m] where m is a constant to [1, encode_size] using variational autoencoder.
